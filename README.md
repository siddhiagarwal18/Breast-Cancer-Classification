# Breast-Cancer-Classification
This project addresses the crucial task of breast cancer classification through advanced 
machine learning techniques. Leveraging Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, 
and XGBoost classifiers, the study aims to accurately discern between benign and malignant 
cases using diagnostic features extracted from medical imaging. The assessment of key metrics such as accuracy, precision, 
recall, and F1 score provides a comprehensive evaluation of the models' efficiency.
